# FlappyBox

A Flappy Bird clone!

* Built a  side scrolling video game following an online tutorial.
* Uses the Jframe class and multiple Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) classes to create graphics.
* Implemented the ActionListener and MouseListener interfaces for user interaction.
* Programmed logic to make the column gaps smaller over time to increase the difficulty the longer you play.
